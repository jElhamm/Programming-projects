# Image Manipulation Program

   This is a Python program that allows users to perform various operations on image files.
   Users can choose from the following actions:

   1. [Reduce Image Size](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-resize-method/): This option reduces the size of the image by half.
   2. [Convert Image Format](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-convert-method/): Users can convert the image format to their desired format. 
   3. [Change Resolution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/change-image-resolution-using-pillow-in-python/): This option allows users to change the resolution of the image.
   4. [Combine Images](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-concatenate-image-using-pillow-in-python/): Users can combine multiple images into a single image.

## Usage

   1. Launch the program.
   2. Choose an action to perform by entering the corresponding number.
   3. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information based on the selected action.
   4. Wait for the program to complete the operation and save the modified image.
   5. Repeat the process if you want to perform additional operations on other images.

## Installation

   1. Make sure you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
   2. Install the PIL library by running the following command:

                            ----------------------------
                            |    pip install Pillow    |
                            ----------------------------

   3. Download and extract the program files to a directory.
   4. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
   5. Run the program by executing the following command:

                            --------------------------------------
                            |    python image_manipulation.py    |
                            --------------------------------------

# Text File Analyzer

   This folder contains two implementations of a text file analyzer, written in C++ and Python.
   Both programs use the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of 
   the FileManager class is created.

## C++ Implementation

   The C++ implementation is provided in the main.cpp file. 
   You can compile and run this program using a C++ compiler.
   The program prompts the user to enter the file path of a text file (with the extension .txt)
   and then analyzes the text in the file. It counts the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, and also determines the frequency of each character.
    
## Python Implementation

   The Python implementation is provided in the main.py file. 
   You can run this program using a Python interpreter.
   Similar to the C++ implementation, the program prompts the user to enter the file path of a text file and performs the same analysis as the C++ program.
   
## Usage

  To use either implementation, follow these steps:

   1. Compile and run the C++ program or run the Python program using a Python interpreter.
   2. Enter the file path of the text file you want to analyze.
   3. The program will display a summary of the file analysis, including the number of lines, words, and   characters in the file, as well as the frequency of each character.

## Note

   The programs assume that the text file with the provided file path exists.
   If the file is not found, an error message will be displayed.


Feel free to use these programs to analyze your own text files and understand their characteristics.

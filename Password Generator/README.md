# Password Generator

   This repository contains a password generator program implemented in different programming languages. 
   The program allows users to generate random passwords based on their preferred length and character types.

# Usage

   The password generator program prompts the user to enter the length of the password and the types of characters they want to include.
   The available character types are:

   1. Lowercase letters
   2. Uppercase letters
   3. Numeric digits
   4. Special characters
   Users can enter their choices by providing the respective numbers separated by spaces.

# C++ Implementation

   The C++ program prompts the user for the password length and the types of characters to include
   (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric digits, or special characters).
    It then generates a random password using the given criteria.
    To run the program, compile and execute the "passwordGenerator.cpp" file.

# Java Implementation

   The Java program also takes input from the user for the password length and the types of characters to include.
   It uses the SecureRandom class to generate a secure random password based on the chosen criteria.
   To run the program, compile and execute the "passwordGenerator.java" file.

# Python Implementation

   The Python implementation provides a command-line interface for the user to enter the password length and select the types of characters to include.
   It uses the random module to generate a random password based on the chosen criteria.
   To run the program, execute the "passwordGenerator.py" file.

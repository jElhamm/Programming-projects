# Drawing 3D Shapes

  The project is a shape visualization tool that displays various geometric shapes
  such as *Cone*, *Cube*, *Cuboid*, *Cylinder8, *Frustum*, and *Sphere*.
  Each shape is accompanied by a screenshot and a brief description.

## Screenshots

### Cone
![Cone](Sample%20outputs/cone.png)

A Cone is a *three-dimensional geometric* shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base to a point called the apex or vertex. It has one curved surface and a circular base.

### Cube
![Cube](Sample%20outputs/cube.png)

A Cube is a *three-dimensional geometric* shape with six square faces of equal size. All angles in a cube are right angles, and all edges have the same length.

### Cuboid
![Cuboid](Sample%20outputs/cuboid.png)

A Cuboid, also known as a rectangular prism, is a *three-dimensional geometric* shape with six rectangular faces. It has opposite faces that are congruent and parallel.

### Cylinder
![Cylinder](Sample%20outputs/cylinder.png)

A Cylinder is a *three-dimensional geometric* geometric shape with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface. It has a constant radius and height.

### Frustum
![Frustum](Sample%20outputs/frustum.png)

A Frustum is a *three-dimensional geometric* shape that resembles a cone with its top portion cut off. It has two parallel circular bases of different sizes connected by a curved surface.

### Sphere
![Sphere](Sample%20outputs/sphere.png)

A Sphere is a *three-dimensional geometric* shape that is perfectly round in shape. It has all points on its surface equidistant from its center.

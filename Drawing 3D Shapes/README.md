# Drawing 3D Shapes

The project is a shape visualization tool that displays various geometric shapes such as cone, cube, cuboid, cylinder, frustum, and sphere. Each shape is accompanied by a screenshot and a brief description.

## Screenshots

### Cone
![Cone](./cone.png)

A cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base to a point called the apex or vertex. It has one curved surface and a circular base.

### Cube
![Cube](./cube.png)

A cube is a three-dimensional geometric shape with six square faces of equal size. All angles in a cube are right angles, and all edges have the same length.

### Cuboid
![Cuboid](./cuboid.png)

A cuboid, also known as a rectangular prism, is a three-dimensional geometric shape with six rectangular faces. It has opposite faces that are congruent and parallel.

### Cylinder
![Cylinder](./cylinder.png)

A cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric shape with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface. It has a constant radius and height.

### Frustum
![Frustum](./frustum.png)

A frustum is a three-dimensional geometric shape that resembles a cone with its top portion cut off. It has two parallel circular bases of different sizes connected by a curved surface.

### Sphere
![Sphere](./sphere.png)

A sphere is a three-dimensional geometric shape that is perfectly round in shape. It has all points on its surface equidistant from its center.

#  HOW  TO  USE

  To use the generated (.jar) file, follow the steps below:

   1. Place the .jar file in a directory of your choice.
   2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
   3. Navigate to the directory where the .jar file is located using the 'cd' command. For example:
                         _______________________________
                        |                               |
                        |    cd C:\path\to\directory    |
                        |_______________________________|

                    Note: The 'cd' command is used for Windows.         
          If you are using a different operating system, use the appropriate
                    command to navigate to the desired directory.

   4. Run the .jar file using the 'java -jar' command followed by the name of the .jar file. For example:
                         _________________________________
                        |                                 |
                        |    java -jar RemoverFile.jar    |
                        |_________________________________|  

   5. A prompt will appear asking for the root path of the computer. Enter the desired root path and press Enter.
   6. The program will start scanning for duplicate files and display the progress and actions taken in the console.
   7. Once the program finishes, it will display a message indicating that duplicate files have been deleted.
   8. You can check the console output for more detailed information on the duplicate files found and removed.

# Note

   The jar file can be run on any operating system that has Java installed, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

   * You can run this file according to the instructions of each operating system.
